# AffineDigramSubstitutionCryptanalysisWithSimpleSwingGUI
This work affects such a thing in cryptography as monoalphabetic affine digram substitution. 
Here several algorithms of modular arithmetic are used (you can test is yourself). 
Also you can encode, decode certain text with any key and crack text, which is encrypted by such an algorithm.
